Building
========
1) Simple building from source is straightforward:
	make distclean or make clean
	make
	sudo make install

2) A debian package can be built using
	make debian 
however it may be easier to download a pre-built package from the web-site where you got the 
source code! The debian build has various toolsets required, but odds-on if you're in to
building debian packages you probably have those already...
